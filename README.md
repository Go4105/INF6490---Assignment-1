COVID-19 Global Dataset Exploration and 1pg Paper

I designed three research questions to better understand the COVID-19 dataset and highlight patterns that could be seen across countries and over time:

1. Which countries had the highest number of active COVID-19 cases per million people?

This question was about fairness in comparison. Raw active case counts don’t mean much unless you adjust for population. Looking at active cases per million gives us a clearer picture of which countries were most affected relative to their size.

2. How did daily new cases vary over time worldwide?

Instead of just looking at averages, I wanted to capture the spread and variability of new cases. Using a box plot helps show the distribution—where most countries fall, who the outliers are, and how extreme the spikes became.

3. Which countries conducted the most testing overall?

Testing capacity shaped the story of the pandemic. Looking at the data through a bar chart helps directly compare testing totals across countries in a way that’s quick and easy to interpret.

Data Insights

For Question 1, the scatter plot of active cases per million by country highlighted that while most countries clustered at the low end, a few stood out with much higher per-capita case counts. This shows that COVID’s impact was very uneven across the world.

For Question 2, the box plot of daily new cases illustrated how wide the variation was. Most countries stayed in the lower range, but a handful experienced extreme spikes, which stretched the distribution and underscored the unpredictable nature of the pandemic.

For Question 3, the bar chart of total tests by country made it clear that testing capacity was highly unequal. Some countries ran millions of tests, while others barely had the infrastructure to test at all. This gap helps explain why reported case numbers differed so much.

Outputs

To visualize these findings, I created:

Scatter Plot – active cases per million by country.

Box Plot – daily new cases distribution.

Bar Chart – total tests by country.

This combination of visualizations provides a mix of comparison (scatter), distribution (box), and ranking (bar). Together, they show not only how COVID-19 spread but also how testing and reporting shaped the global data story.
